Installing Cutting Edge
====================

MANUAL

This assumes you have a 64 bit processor. If you don't know what that is, you probably shouldn't be trying to install Cutting Edge manually. Okay, download the ZIP and copy the "compiled" folder to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods. Not the contents, the folder "compiled". Now, restart Steam. You should see GrundFPS on the Steam game list.

THE EASY WAY

This ONLY works if you have a 64 bit processor. If you don't, use manual.
Download the zip and run cuttingedge_1.exe or just download cuttingedge_1.exe using this link: https://github.com/theultimateboogie/GrundFPS_CuttingEdge/blob/master/cuttingedge_1.exe?raw=true
After it's finished installing, restart Steam.
This installs it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\CuttingEdge.
NOTE: The install might say it will install to C:\Program Files (x86)\theultimateboogie\GrundFPS Cutting Edge. Leave this alone, that's where it puts the uninstaller.
