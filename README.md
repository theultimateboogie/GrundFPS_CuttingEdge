Installing Cutting Edge
====================

MANUAL

This assumes you have a 64 bit processor. If you don't know what that is, you probably shouldn't be trying to install Cutting Edge manually. Okay, download the ZIP and copy the "compiled" folder to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods. Not the contents, the folder "compiled". Now, restart Steam. You should see GrundFPS on the Steam game list.

THE EASY WAY

This ONLY works if you have a 64 bit processor. If you don't, use manual.
Download the zip and run the latest installer.
After it's finished installing, restart Steam.
This installs it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\CuttingEdge.
NOTE: The install might say it will install to C:\Program Files (x86)\theultimateboogie\GrundFPS Cutting Edge. Leave this alone, that's where it puts the uninstaller.


"Official Server"
====================
Official Server on the main menu will not connect to a server yet. (That is unless you have a server on the IP of 127.0.0.1:27015) We need someone to host servers, if anyone can. Contact me at wrenched@rbaa.site.nfoservers.com if you can.
