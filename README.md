Installing Cutting Edge
====================
This assumes you have a 64 bit processor. If you don't know what that is, you probably shouldn't be trying to install Cutting Edge. Okay, download the ZIP and copy the "compiled" folder to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods. Not the contents, the folder "compiled". Now, restart Steam. You should see GrundFPS on the Steam game list.


Note
